#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) At first this pseudocode seems like it would be of runtime O(n^3) because as n increases, so does the amount of while loops by n^3, however, since n^2 is added every time I believe the final time complexity to be: O(n).

b) In this case, the code would run n times every single time no matter what due to the for loop. Then the while loop would cause the code to run what I believe to be n/2 times. Meaning the final time complexity is: O(n^2).

c) I'm assuming since there is no input size of n, the time complexity would be O(1).

## Exercise II

<!-- throwing eggs off n-story building, many eggs -->
<!-- eggs only break at floor equal or greater to f -->
<!-- strategy to determine f such that dropped + broken eggs is minimized -->

<!-- similar to knapsack problem -->
<!-- bunch of objects, want to maximize value of haul -->
<!-- which items do we take? -->

<!-- No idea what this question is asking though....  -->
<!-- wouldn't the best strategy just be to stay below floor f and have 0 broken eggs and 100% dropped? -->
<!-- Ask iris -->
